# Getting to the next level of Deep Learning with fastai.

Reading the book [Grokking Deep Learning](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/grokking-deep-learning/9781617293702/) was a great introduction to the code behind deep learning systems.  It allowed me, as a long-time software developer to finally
understand how a computer could do things such as recognising characters without being directly programmed to do so.

As a developer you're expecting to have to write logic that explains to the computer the steps it should take to solve some problem and so despite decades of
experience as a software developer I didn't have a clue how to write software to analyse an image.

Grokking Deep Learning really helped me to understand the logic (and how simple it really is) that underlies deep learning.  It takes quite a few chapters
to get to a system that can recognise hand-written characters but the approach taken by this book works well for a developer who wants to understand how it works.

Now I've started my next book, [Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/deep-learning-for/9781492045519/).  This book jumps right in and before you're even halfway through the first chapter
we've already used deep learning to recognise cats in images.  By the end of the first chapter you'll also have a model that segments a photo into parts such as cars,
trees, people and the road; another that can predict the sentiment of a sentence and another that can recognise sounds.

This book moves fast!  Excited to see where it takes me!
